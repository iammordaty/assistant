# assistant
My web-based music collection assistant

## features
- search
- browse
- find similar tracks (based on track similarity* and metadata fields: initial_key, bpm, genre, year)
- rearrange mix by similarity (experimental)

\* Thanks to [Musly - Music Similarity Library](https://github.com/dominikschnitzer/musly)

## plans
- find inconsistencies / mismatches in track metadata ("WatermÃ¤t" vs "Watermat", "The Disciples" vs. "Disciples", and so on)
- i18n
- custom tags to tracks info
- integrate Indexer with [Essentia](https://github.com/MTG/essentia) (which is "library for audio and music analysis, description and synthesis")
- opt out of a backend written in go
- upgrade to PHP7
- ...?

## requirements
- PHP >= 5.6
- PHP MongoDB Extension (php5-mongo) >= 1.6.0
- MongoDB >= 3.x (2.x should works too)
- nginx / Apache
